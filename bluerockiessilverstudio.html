<img src="img/brss1.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss selected" data-image="img/brss1.webp" data-note="<b>Project Overview</b><br><br>Blue Rockies Silver Studio is a handcrafted jewelry brand founded by Sheren, a talented metalsmith who draws her inspiration from the striking beauty of the Western Rockies and the peaceful charm of the Eastern coastline. I made some major updates to the project after some time had passed so that it would better match my skills and knowledge i had learnt since then. Also fun fact, the left version is my first shot at a brand identity project. The right version is the most recent updates. ">
 <img src="img/brss2.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss2.webp" data-note="<b>Tagline & Brand Vision</b><br><br>The brand’s tagline, “Forging Connections with Nature,” captures its mission: to help people build a deeper bond with nature by wearing jewelry crafted from natural materials. The visual identity is grounded in Canadian landscapes—specifically mountains and large bodies of water. This reflects Sheren’s love for the natural world and the environments that inspire her work.">
 <img src="img/brss3.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss3.webp" data-note="<b>Logo & Symbolism</b><br><br>The logo is designed to resemble a pendant, symbolizing Sheren’s craftsmanship. Within the pendant, you’ll see stylized Rocky Mountains above a calm body of water, tying together the two key landscapes that inspire her. The primary logo is a lock-up and should be used wherever possible. The secondary logo is a simplified wordmark, useful in smaller or minimal layouts.">
<img src="img/brss4.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss4.webp" data-note="<b>Favicon & Brand Pattern</b><br><br>For the favicon, I took a segment of the logo, duplicated it three times to form a leaf—symbolizing the brand’s love for nature. Then I duplicated that symbol four times to create a circular formation representing unity and connection. This symbol was used to create the brand’s pattern as well.">
 <img src="img/brss5.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss5.webp" data-note="<b>Color Palette</b><br><br>The color palette consists of four different shades of blue along with a silvery white, creating a cool, natural palette that mirrors water and metal.">
 <img src="img/brss6.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss6.webp" data-note="<b>Typography: Titles</br><br><br>For typography, the primary typeface is Elsie Swash Caps, used in titles and headers. I chose this font specifically because its curves reminded me of the movement of water.">
  <img src="img/brss7.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss7.webp" data-note="<b>Typography: Body Copy</b><br><br>For body copy, I selected Poppins—a clean and modern sans-serif thats easy to read for long bodies of text.">
 <img src="img/brss8.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/brss8.webp" data-note="<b>Website Design</b><br><br>Lastly here’s the website design, and a standout feature I want to mention is the share icon placed beside the store icon, making it easy for visitors to share their favorite pieces on social media. Since social platforms are essential for e-commerce success, this feature helps expand Sheren’s reach and visibility online. By combining strong visuals, a heartfelt mission, and thoughtful design choices, this brand identity aims to set Blue Rockies Silver Studio up for long-term success.">
