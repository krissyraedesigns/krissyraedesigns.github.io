<img src="img/p!nk11.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss selected" data-image="img/p!nk11.webp" data-note="<b>Recreating The Moment</b><br><br>This poster started as a class assignment for my Illustrator 2 course. I had just seen P!NK live, and while researching ideas, I found this photo of her suspended mid-air, dressed in white, wings added — it looked like she was glowing. I knew instantly that I wanted to recreate that exact moment in illustration form. I drew her pose by hand on my tablet, added angelic wings, and designed a background that mimicked looking up into a circus tent. The vibe was dramatic and ethereal — just like she is on stage. While the first version had solid energy, things like the typography and detail work still had room to grow.">
 <img src="img/p!nk21.webp" class="ppt-thumb brss" data-image="img/p!nk21.webp" data-note="<b>Final Version & What I learned</b><br><br>In the final version, I took everything further: I refined the layout, changed her pose to feel even more iconic, and added a bold spotlight behind her to amplify the drama. The type was redone with a graffiti-style “P!NK” that matched her wild energy, and I brought in silk ribbons to create movement and flow. Recreating that original photo helped me improve not just my illustration skills, but also how I translate real-life energy into design. More than anything, this project taught me the value of good typography, intentional composition, and pushing until it finally feels right.">
