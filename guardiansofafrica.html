<img src="img/goa1.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa selected" data-image="img/goa1.webp" data-note="<b>A Reimagined Editorial Concept</b><br><br>Guardians of Africa is a conceptual magazine project designed to educate and inspire through the beauty, diversity, and depth of African wildlife. Originally created for youth ages 12–16, the first version didn’t quite hit the mark. After stepping away and returning to the project during my Portfolio 1 course, I reimagined the magazine with a clearer audience in mind: women with a passion for wildlife and conservation. This shift opened up the design — allowing it to feel more intentional, refined, and aligned with my original vision.

 <img src="img/goa2.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa" data-image="img/goa2.webp" data-note="<b>What Went Wrong in Version One</b><br><br>While the first draft had potential, there were several missteps. The typography didn’t match the tone. Some spreads lacked visual clarity. And despite aiming to engage a younger demographic, the execution felt too generic. The rushed production also resulted in spelling errors and layout inconsistencies that made the piece feel unfinished.">
 <img src="img/goa3.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa" data-image="img/goa3.webp" data-note="<b>Refining the Design Direction</b><br><br>The second version began with a clear pivot: new audience, new energy. I overhauled the type system to create stronger hierarchy and readability, making the magazine feel more polished and editorial. I redesigned the layout with intention, incorporated more structure, and introduced a clean, minimalist color palette inspired by African landscapes — warm neutrals, deep browns, and soft shadows.">
<img src="img/goa4.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa" data-image="img/goa4.webp" data-note="<b>A Mood Inspired by the African Sunset<b><br><br>One of the most impactful changes was the switch to silhouette imagery. Inspired by the idea of a picture-perfect African sunset, the new visuals use contrast and shadow to evoke a sense of wonder and quiet power. The minimalist approach also brought the content forward, letting the typography and storytelling lead.">
 <img src="img/goa5.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa" data-image="img/goa5.webp" data-note="<b>Grounded in Nature: The Color Palette</b><br><br>This project was a turning point in my understanding of typography. I refined font pairings to create intentional visual rhythm — making sure headlines stood tall and confident, while body copy felt clean and easy to follow. The final type choices struck the right balance between strength and sophistication.

 <img src="img/goa6.webp" class="ppt-thumb goa" data-image="img/goa6.webp" data-note="<b>Typography That Tells the Right Story</b><br><br>The second version of Guardians of Africa finally became what I had envisioned all along. It’s more mature, more thoughtful, and far more effective. This project taught me the value of stepping back, listening to feedback, and leaning into the process of iteration. Most of all, it showed me how much I’ve grown as a designer — and how much further I still want to go.">
