    <p><strong>C:\\Users\\Krissy&gt;MyStory</strong></p>
I didn’t apply to VCAD — my boyfriend Jerraco did. He signed me up without telling me, and I found out when I got a call from admissions. I remember shaking my head at him like, “What did you do?” Because honestly, I never saw myself as creative. I wasn’t that kid spaninging crayon drawings to my grandma, the woman who raised me. Creativity wasn’t part of my identity — I had other interests, more scientific ones. I wanted to study biology or zoology. I imagined a future in lab coats or working with animals, not sketchbooks and style guides.
<span class="small-space"><span>
But then COVID hit. I lost my job during the pandemic, and everything paused. Jerraco saw an opportunity. He thought it was the perfect time for both of us to try something new, and he believed I’d be good at art. At the time, I spent most of my days editing photos — not drawing or illustrating, just blending images together and making them work as a whole. When VCAD called, I told the administrator point-blank: “Please make sure the program isn’t too creative. I don’t really draw.” Because I didn’t. I was visual, sure. But not an artist.
<span class="small-space">
Then came three drawing classes, a full lineup of design software, and a huge shift in my life.
<span class="small-space">
Jerraco passed away just two months after I started the program.
<span class="small-space">
Everything changed.
<span class="small-space">
But I stayed. I committed to the program, to the work, and eventually — to the craft. I started from scratch, far behind the people who’d been drawing since childhood or designing in high school. And yet, I’ve poured everything into learning and improving. I’m motivated. I’m determined. I’m endlessly curious. I want to learn everything there is to know about this field that I somehow lived so long without.
<span class="small-space">
Now? I create every day. I genuinely love design — not just for the art, but for the connection it spanings. Especially when I’m designing for someone else.
<span class="small-space">
I’ve always been the friend who wants to fix your problems. Maybe that’s a side effect of being bullied most of my life. I just try to make people feel safe when they’re with me — heard, understood, and at ease. That’s exactly how I approach my work too.
<span class="small-space">
When we work together, I’m not designing for me.
I’m designing for you.
<span class="small-space">
I listen carefully. I ask thoughtful questions. I care about what you’re trying to say — and I want to help you say it in a way that feels honest and impactful. I may not have the most traditional journey, but I promise you this: I spaning heart, grit, and genuine intention into every piece I create.
<span class="small-space">
If that sounds like what you’re looking for, I’d love to hear from you.
